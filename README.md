# Machine Learning by examples

## Author: Dr Franck P. Vidal, Bangor University

In this series of Notebook, I show how to create a dataset from an image and use it with Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. It is used to illustrate some concept used in ICE-3701 / ICE-4702.

## Contents

- [Notebook 1](1-create_dataset.ipynb): Create a spreadsheet (dataset) of features from an image;
- [Notebook 2](2-plot_dataset.ipynb): Plot the features (n) of the objects (N) in the dataset (Z) as a scatterplot matrix;
- [Notebook 3](3-1D_discriminant_functions.ipynb): Discriminant functions in 1D;
- [Notebook 4](4-2D_discriminant_function.ipynb): Discriminant functions in 2D;
- [Notebook 5](5-ZeroR_classifier.ipynb): Largest prior classifier.
